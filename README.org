#+TITLE: simplicity-theme for Emacs

Please note this theme is still under development. Also PRs & ideas are welcome.

** About

Simplicity is a dark minimalist Emacs theme. Most of the colors have been turned off. Only a touch of a few vivid colors remains (on stuff like errors, search, parenthesis, etc). It's my personal belief that because it gets rid of any distraction, it helps focus on reading and writing code after getting used to it. I also really like the "raw" feeling it provides.

** Installation

*** From the Git repository

Clone the repository:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/smallwat3r/emacs-simplicity-theme.git
#+end_src

And add the following to your ~.emacs~ file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/simplicity-theme")
(load-theme 'simplicity t)
#+end_src

*** Doom Emacs

Add the following to your ~packages.el~ file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! simplicity-theme :recipe
  (:host github
   :repo "smallwat3r/emacs-simplicity-theme"))
#+end_src

Then load the theme in your ~config.el~ file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'simplicity)
#+end_src

** Customization

You can tweak the theme by changing a few colors by defining new values in the ~simplicity-override-colors-alist~ variable before loading the theme.

For example, for a very high contrast theme:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq simplicity-override-colors-alist
      '(("simplicity-background" . "#000000")   ; full dark bg
        ("simplicity-foreground" . "#ffffff"))) ; full light fg
(load-theme 'simplicity t)
#+end_src

To see the full list of color names you can override, please consult the ~simplicity-theme.el~ source file.
